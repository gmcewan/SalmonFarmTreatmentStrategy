To run the model requires the AnyLogic modelling software. It can be
downloaded from http://www.anylogic.com There is a free (but limited)
version available.


To run the model with real-time output
-------------------------------
NB: This will do a single iteration of the model. Stochastic variation
may mean that the output is non-typical.

1. Open "Salmon Farms (treatment).alp" in AnyLogic.

2. In the bar of icons at the top of the window, there is a green
circle with a white arrow in it. Next to that is a small black arrow
pointing down. Click on the black arrow and select 
"Salmon Farms (treatment).alp / Simulation"

3. There will be a short wait (with a progress bar from AnyLogic) and
a new window will appear with three text boxes.

4. In the text boxes, enter file names that are in the right format
for those types of files. They files must appear in the "input/"
folder. There are examples already there that we used in our
scenarios.


To run a batch of iterations
-----------------------

* This requires the University Researcher or Professional versions of
AnyLogic.

1. In the leftmost pane of the AnyLogic window (labelled "Projects"),
click on "RunTrials" (it's near the bottom). New text will appear in
the rightmost pane.

2. Change the values at the top. The "name" is the name of the output
directory that will be created in "output/", "numberOfCycles" is the
number of production cycles that will be simulated, "numberOfTrials"
is the number of independent iterations to be run  with these
parameters.

3. It will take a while for the simulation to finish. There will be
some output on progress at the bottom of the AnyLogic window. At the
end there will be a number of csv files in the output directory you
specified.


To produce pretty charts like we did in the paper
--------------------------------------

1. We have included the R scripts that we used to produce figures 2,
3, and 4. We include instructions to use these from the command
line. The scripts are designed to work on multiple output directories
that have the same names that we used. If you want something
different, the scripts should be modified.

2. Open a command line. Change to the output/ directory.

3. Run the command "r -f run_all_plots.r"

4. There will be three new pdf files in the output/ directory:
licecount.pdf, treatments.pdf, and resistances.pdf
